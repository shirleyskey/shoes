== Installation ==


Manual install:

Upload `upicrm.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and extract all files.

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

note: you can always download UpiCRM form our web site: www.upicrm.com/download



Automatic installation:

While on "Add New" screen on "Plugins" page from your WordPress dashboard / management screen - simply search for UpiCRM, and click the "install now" link.

Be sure to activate UpiCRM plugin after installation!



First time configuration:

After installing the plugin from upicrm.com website, or from "plugins" page on your WordPress site, you will need to perform the following actions before you can enjoy the capabilities of UpiCRM:



First Step: Set up users and roles.



UpiCRM has two built in user roles:



UpiCRM Admin: Can configure all options, grant access rights, view and edit all leads, access UpiCRM dashboard, and perform any additional task UpiCRM allows.



UpiCRM User: Can view & manage leads assigned to him only.



Simply create a WordPress user using the default "Users" menu provided by your WordPress management interface, or edit existing WordPress users, by navigating to the lower end of the page, and assigning the new user with the desired UpiCRM role:



Note: remember that you can simply assign UpiCRM user roles using the native users management screens of WordPress.



UpiCRM General Settings:



"Send all leads and updates to the following user": you may choose to distribute new leads by mail to any external eMail address, or to a list of multiple comma separated (",") eMail addresses.



"By default, Leads are assigned to" : use this option in order to determine who will be assigned to deal with all new leads.



"Email format":  you can choose to send mail notifications as plain text or HTML. As some external systems (SalesForce, ZohoCRM etc.) require plain text in order to parse new leads, you may choose to change default format to plain text.



Change default "from" field for emails sent from UpiCRM: use this option in order to set the "from" name used on email that will be sent by UpiCRM.





Step 2: map all your existing forms and fields onto UpiCRM's structured database

UpiCRM needs to import all your old data and map all your current forms and fields onto its superset of structured database.

In order to perform this task, navigate to the "General Settings" screen on the UpiCRM sub-menu.

Please remember to perform this task again if you're adding more new forms to your site in the future!



Use the drop-down menus on this screen in order to map ALL your current forms fields onto the UpiCRM structured database.



Tip: if you are using an additional field that does not appear on the UpiCRM predefined fields list, you can always add it to the UpiCRM database using the "Add additional fields and datatypes to UpiCRM" option.



Note: this procedure needs to be performed only once per every form on your website.

UpiCRM Lead status: Use this screen in order to add or change a status.







Step 3: Edit eMail notifications

UpiCRM will consistently inform you and your team about any reception/edition/modification of any lead.

Take a couple of minutes in order to personalize the messages you wish to distribute, by editing the eMail templates on the "eMail Notifications" screen:



Tip: use the variable [lead],  [url] and [assign-to] in order to embed information with the notifications you send.

In the future, UpiCRM will provide even more optional variables.



Step 4: Optional - define rules and conditions automatically route leads to designated personnel or to change lead status.

ANALYSIS, TRACKING, MARKETING EFFECTIVENES WITH UPICRM

The Challenge: Tracking leads from actual traffic source – campaigns, referring sites, search engines etc., through the complete life-cycle of every lead, and creating the full picture about your marketing effectiveness.





UpiCRM supports URL tagging used for identifying traffic sources to a web site.

Note: Please read more about URL Builder provided by Google. (link)

Basically what this means is that if you tag all your inbound traffic in compliance with the UTM tagging rules, UpiCRM will attach the traffic source to each and every lead received.



In addition, UpiCRM will also attach the HTTP referrer parameter to every lead, so you'll be able to track the source per every lead in your database.

On the bigger picture: With UpiCRM you will be able to analyze the effectiveness of all your marketing activities and traffic sources, both on a single lead basis, and up to a complete reporting and analytics information.



The way to achieve this is simply by adding the built-in fields  - ‘HTTP referrer’, ‘Campaign Source’ (utm_source), ‘Campaign Medium’ (utm_medium), ‘Campaign Term’ (utm_term) , ‘Campaign Content’ (utm_content), ‘Campaign Name’ (utm_campaign) - to the default "View leads" table.

Alternatively, simply export all data to excel in order to create your own views and analysis.
